# 🐍 Logic Box: Python Pattern & Math Tool

Welcome to **Logic Box**! This is a Python-based utility I developed during my first year of BCA studies to practice core programming concepts.

## 📖 Overview
Logic Box is an interactive command-line application that allows users to generate visual patterns and perform mathematical analysis on ranges of numbers. This project focuses on implementing clean control flow and efficient loops.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Pattern Generation:** Generates a right-angled star (`*`) pattern based on user-defined row counts.
* **Range Analysis:** Iterates through a user-provided range to identify even and odd numbers.
* **Sum Calculation:** Automatically calculates the total sum of all integers within the selected range.
* **Dynamic Menu:** Features a persistent menu system using a `match-case` structure for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Control Structures:** Utilized `if`, `else`, and `match-case` for decision-making logic.
* **Iteration:** Implemented nested `for` loops for geometric patterns and `while` loops for continuous execution.
* **User Interaction:** Managed dynamic input/output via the terminal console.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/logic-box.git](https://github.com/your-username/logic-box.git)
    ```
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python "Logic Box.py"
    ```
3.  **Choose an option (1-3)** from the on-screen menu to start exploring!
